bmc
==========

bmc is a simple beanstalkd management utillity.

## Roadmap (todo?)
  * Proper error handling (logging all beanstalkd errors to log.Fatal is not cool)
  * Implement all features
  * Optional encoding, for example printing tube_stats as json.
  * Allow file handling for tube_put

## License
bmc is licensed under the new bsd license, see LICENSE.md.
